QUES 1
In computer systems, an access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, 
the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application.
    An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.[1] A token is used to make
security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to 
represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the
token is being created. Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege, for example to create a new token with 
lower levels of access rights to restrict the access of a launched application. An access token is used by Windows when 
a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors (securable objects).
